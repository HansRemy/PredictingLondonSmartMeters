### Proposel: 
I found a Kaggle dataset with smart meter reading of 5,567 London household between November 2011 and February 2014. This dataset contains daily consumption and half hourly meter reading. It also got social data about the household and weather data of the London area during that period.

I want to make predictions of electricity consumptions in the future.

Why is this important

1)‘Balancing the grid’ in electricity is very important to avoid blackouts, to do is in an efficient way you need to have predictions of consumption. 
2) in ‘free’ electricity markets, suppliers need to buy electricity at the spot market. If they can predict future consumption, they can buy up front and make better deals and can even speculate.
